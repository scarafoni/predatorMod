    <h3>Task Instructions:</h3>
    <!-- Chorus instructions
    <p>You and other workers are collectively chatting with the "requester" via an instant messenger in order to answer their questions. Your goal is to make it seem as though you are just one person. Post responses and choose which messages (posted by others) would be a proper response.</p>

    <p>You will be rewarded/bonused for typing or clicking helpful content. If you experience any technical issues, please contact the requester.</p>

    <p><b>You will see the following interface during the task:</b></p>

    <p style="color:red"> (Note: Please avoid using Chrome browser if possible)</p>
    <p>Interact with a blind user by listening to his/her audio questions and answering via chat message. You will see a live video that shows information needed to answer the questions. Before you type your responses, you should <strong>check the pending answers</strong> in the chat box to see if anyone else has already suggested something helpful (you will see a pink box). If they have, <strong>click on it to agree</strong>. Once enough people have clicked, it will be sent to the user (and turn white). <strong>If no other answers fit, please type a new one</strong>. The <strong>goal</strong> of the task is to respond as quickly as you can accurately. You can <strong>take screenshots</strong> of the video to see the details of objects, signs, items etc.</p>

    <p>You will be <strong>rewarded/bonused</strong> for typing or clicking helpful content.</p>
